Problem Statement

Organization “Silara Retail”  is inviting the Developers and Data Scientists to build a high performing recommendation engine for their online retail portal.
They are making their last one year customer transaction (anonymized) data available. For the customers in test data, the participants need to recommend the next items that they are most likely to buy.
You are expected to build a high performing recommendation engine using IBM Cloud services. You are encouraged to use IBM Watson Studio Apache spark based Jupyter notebook.
The model created should be readily consumable by the organization and hence you are expected to expose the model as API endpoint.Watson Machine Learning (WML) available through IBM Cloud can be explored for the same.
