# Build-a-recommendation-engine

ABOUT THE CHALLENGE

There is a growing expectation from customers in the digital world to have a more personalized experience and business owners wanting to become more data driven so they can stay one step ahead of the competition and focus on what matters most: building their business.
 
IBM invites the Developers and Data Scientists to compete for this challenge of developing an optimized, high performing recommendation system for a retail organization who would like to provide a personalized shopping experience to stay ahead of the competition.
 
Business stakeholders don't care much on how fancy the algorithm is. They care more about how it can move the needle on their key business challenges.
 
Here is the opportunity to prove that Data Science is all about solving the real business problem not just models or algorithm alone. Are you ready to take up this challenge?


Problem Statement

Organization “Silara Retail”  is inviting the Developers and Data Scientists to build a high performing recommendation engine for their online retail portal.
They are making their last one year customer transaction (anonymized) data available. For the customers in test data, the participants need to recommend the next items that they are most likely to buy.
You are expected to build a high performing recommendation engine using IBM Cloud services. You are encouraged to use IBM Watson Studio Apache spark based Jupyter notebook.
The model created should be readily consumable by the organization and hence you are expected to expose the model as API endpoint.Watson Machine Learning (WML) available through IBM Cloud can be explored for the same.
